# Lakeland Genealogical Portal
## Description
The Lakeland Genealogical Portal is a project developed during the summer of 2024 as part of INST490. Our team was tasked with creating a user-friendly, publicly accessible digital archive that preserves and showcases the rich history of the Lakeland Community in College Park MD while also allowing for community-driven data expansion and engagement. 

This website displays Census data from 1900,1920,1930,1940,1950 and 1965 Voter Registration records and allows users to explore the available datasets and make searches across and within the database. This application was built on Node.js using Supabase to store data and Vercel to deploy. 

This prototype serves as the stepping stones for a functional genealogical tool that will allow users with connections to Lakeland to explore their roots and hopefully find new connections.

## Prerequisites
Users should have Node.js and Node Package Manager installed.

Node.js can be installed through Node Version Manager - follow this [link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/)

Once Node Version Manager is installed, Node.js can be installed using the following command:

`nvm install node`

Installation via Node Version Manager automatically installs Node Package Manager.

## Dependencies
- Express.js
- Nodemon
- Body-parser
- Suapbase
- Tailwind
- Data Tables Javascript Library
- Bootstrap

## Installation

1. Open your code editor (VSCode was used for the development of this project). 
2. Type “npm install” into the terminal of your code editor.
3. This will install all the dependencies needed for the application.
4. Go to your browser and type localhost:3000, the application will be available to view.
